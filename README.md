## 14 textos Apalaí

A project giving the Apalaí corpus by [Koehn & Koehn (1994)](etc/apalai.bib) a lift.

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

The goal of this project is to bring the glossed texts in Koehn & Koehn (1994) into a curated electronic form.
The resulting corpus will be interesting for corpus linguistic investigations of Apalaí, as well as for Cariban digital historical linguistics, whatever the focus.
Due to copyright reasons, I cannot reproduce the entire corpus from:

> Koehn, Edward & Sally Koehn (1994). 14 textos Apalaí. Brasília: Summer Institute of Linguistics.

### Output
* a [sample of the current CLDF version](cldf/examples_sample.csv) of the corpus
* A [form concordance](stats/form-concordance.tsv) made with [pyigt](https://github.com/cldf/pyigt)
* a quick-and-dirty [count of Sa verbs](stats/apalai_sa_verb_stats.csv) for [this project](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_irregular_1)
